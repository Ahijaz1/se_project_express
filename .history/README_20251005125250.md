# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The WTWR (What to Wear?) Back-End project is the server-side component of the WTWR web application, designed to provide a secure and scalable API for managing users, clothing items, and weather-based outfit suggestions. This project demonstrates the core principles of back-end web development, including building a RESTful API, integrating a database, implementing authentication, and deploying to a production environment.

The WTWR backend serves as the foundation for the front-end application. Its main purpose is to handle requests, store and retrieve data from the database, and ensure secure communication between the client and server.

The Core Features are listed below;

// User Management:
Create new users and manage their profiles.
Implement secure login and registration with hashed passwords.
Use JWT (JSON Web Token) for authorization and session control.

// Item Management:
Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) clothing items.
Store item data including name, image URL, weather type, and owner.
Only authenticated users can add or delete their own items.

// Weather-based Suggestions:
Fetch items filtered by weather type (e.g., hot, warm, cold).
Allow users to “like” or “unlike” items.

// API & Error Handling:
RESTful API endpoints for all CRUD operations.
Centralized error handling and validation.
Clear and consistent HTTP responses for both success and error states.

Got to use and get fimilar with Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose.

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
